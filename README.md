# FIWARE Open API Specifications 

This repository contains FIWARE Open API specifications. 

The `OpenAPI` folder is meant to contain the Swagger JSON specifications for FIWARE GEs. 

The `gh-pages` folder will be synchronized with the master folder. In the `gh-pages` folder there is an existing, legacy `ngsiv2` folder which contains the Apiary rendering of the NGSIv2 specification. 

Please note that in the near future FIWARE Foundation does not plan to maintain anymore Apiary specifications. Particularly the NGSIv2 specification will be superseded at some point in time by the NGSI-LD specification soon to be published by ETSI.
